# The Vishualizer


This project has been designed to enhance your Spotify listening experience with a Visualizer. 

The program dyamicaly changes from song to song by taking the information recived in the Spotify api (which descibes the Song Features). Spotify has several api's which contain a range of information from the Current user, the users current play state and song information. 

We used the song Audio Features to alter the visualizer which closer matches the song being played. This api call recives information on a range of perameters like Danceability, Tempo to its Valance(positivity) from which the program alters the size, speed, color and more. 



## Getting Started

To use this program from your computer there are a few steps that need to be followed.
Create a new directory in which you will make two sub directories, one for the Client side and the other for the Server. Make sure you clone each repository in its respective folder.
Client Front End repository is liked here:
Server Back End repository from the following link:

After both repository are cloned then in each root directory run npm install in order to download the required packages which enable the program to both run and be tested.

At this point you will need to open two separate terminals. Direct the terminal to the root directory of each folder and follow the desciption below 
To load the Front End server run: npm start
To load the Back End server run: node authorization_code/App.js



### Prerequisites

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

We used two test frame works for this project.
Unit Test were done using Jest which is a Java script based test bed.

Features Test were built around the Cypress test framework which was used on the 

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

We used a range of languages and frameworks to build this program.

Npm: Was used to build the frame work of the back end server.
